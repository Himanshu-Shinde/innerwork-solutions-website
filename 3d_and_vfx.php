                    <h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
                    <p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and
                        macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the software has
                        become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole.
                        The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to
                        photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest") although Adobe discourages such use.
                        [5] Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha
                        compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone.

                    <h2>Architecture Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.[1] The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building.[2] It functions as a blueprint for the system and the developing project, laying out the tasks necessary to be executed by the design teams.[3]

                    <h2>Game Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Game design is the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes. Increasingly, elements and principles of game design are also applied to other interactions, in the form of gamification.

Game design creates goals, rules and challenges to define a board game, card game, dice game, casino game, role-playing game, sport, video game, war game or simulation that produces desirable interactions among its participants and, possibly, spectators.
